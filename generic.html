							<p>I was born in the Bay Area. My hobbies contain playing games such as Valorant, League of Legends (sadly), Roblox, and Pokemon, specifically the earlier versions of pokemon because it is what I am most familiar with. On Roblox, I played a lot of games but primarily games that contained RNG aspects which made me play for hours on end. An example is Dungeon Quest, a game where the player fights dungeons containing mobs and bosses for loot. Plans that I have for the future is working for these big gaming industries like Riot Games, Epic, etc. </p>
							<p>I am a beginner coder (I consider myself to be). I have created a basic game on GDevelop that is claled Worka Lot. In the game it depicts a character who is worked overtime and has to meet a Quota by the end of the game. </p>
